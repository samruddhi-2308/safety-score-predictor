# Safety Score Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts regional safety levels using crime and population data.

## Overview
This project builds a full ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, target construction, model training, dimensionality reduction (PCA), model persistence, and inference.

Safety levels are classified as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**, relative to crime rates within the dataset.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest
- PCA

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies
